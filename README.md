# Himovies unnoficial api

This node module webscrapes a himovies clone site then grabs the 
movies and tv-shows from it, it also supports subtitle downloading.
However this module uses puppeteer to grab video links and subtitles

## Requirements

- Nodejs installed with npm (Node v15+ and npm v6+)

- Mpv (video player)

## Installation

1.) Clone this repository, and cd into it

		``` 
		npm install  //install the dependencies (puppeteer, axios, etc..)
		node index.js //start the example app I made...
		
		```

## Some notes

This module uses some extensions when grabbing video links, extensions like Ublock and Ghostery are already in the lib/ directory, feel free to add some more if you want...
